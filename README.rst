=================
A MUD named B MUD
=================

This is a multi-user dungeon game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) written in Racket (http://racket-lang.org/).
This is also my first non-trivial Scheme learning project.

Usage
======

Racket 5.3 or later is required.

Run `racket mud.rkt` to start the server on port 1234.
Only ANSI compliant terminals are supported (really, just my terminal is supported).
